# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Study-for-Tolerance-Interval-Computation
This repository contains code to compute tolerance intervals using four different methods (normal distribution, non-parametric, order statistics bootstrap, kernel density estimation with bootstrapping). Results for various distributions are computed.
